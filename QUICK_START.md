## ⚠️ Important Note: Email Functionality

**GitHub Pages serves static sites only**, which means:

❌ **Email functionality will NOT work** (no server for API routes)
- Form will display but emails won't send
- This is a GitHub Pages limitation

### 💡 Solutions:

**Option 1: Use Both Deployments**
- GitHub Pages: For preview/portfolio (no emails)
- Hostinger: For production with working emails

**Option 2: Use Client-Side Email Service**
- EmailJS (https://www.emailjs.com/) - sends from browser
- Formspree (https://formspree.io/) - form service

**Option 3: Deploy to Hostinger Only**
- Follow `HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Full email functionality works
